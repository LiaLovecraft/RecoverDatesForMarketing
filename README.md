# RecoverDatesForMarketing
Coding exercise for Valant

A program to attempt to recover dates from a possibly corrupted data file. 

Actually, the very first thing I would do would be to see if there is any possible way to get a fresh export - corrupted data 
files are of course not reliable, and I would personally hate for decisions of any sort to be made based on them. Failing this, 
I would see if there are any examples of previously received non-corrupt files from the same source. Having said that, I did go 
ahead and code a first version of a recovery attempt.

I chose to do this via the following process:
1. Strip out non-printing characters using a regular expression
2. Identify "date-like" 8 digit strings using another regular expression. This results in the first two characters
	being integers between 01 and 12, the next two characters being integers between 01 and 31, and the last four 
	characters being integers
3. Use DateTime.TryParseExact to filter out non-dates from step 2 (i.e., leap year violations, "June 31st" dates, etc.)
4. Filter using today's date to exclude any dates from step 3 >= today

I have concerns and questions about this, which I would convey to marketing: 
1. Even the exact-match dates pulled from the file may be false positives, as the corruption may have 
	produced a valid date due to character substitution or insertion. 
2. I would ask if the dates I was able to recover match their expectations considering the intent of the data 
	(i.e., dates in the middle ages and before might be expected if the subject matter was "History of Feudalism in Europe," 
	 but not if the subject matter was "History of the Chevrolet Corvette").
3. I would show them the exact date matches, and then explain that I could take further and ever-less-confident steps 
	to try to pull dates out, such as:
		a. checking each 8-digit number that doesn't evaluate to a valid date to see if mutations 
			(substitutions, transposition) would render possibly valid dates
		b. checking to see if there are possible insertions in the middle of dates, such that removing 
			a set of numerals reveals a valid date possibility
4. I would stress to them that #3 would result in a high probability of false positives. If they did want to see the 
	results of this, I would devise some arbitrary confidence scale, and reduce confidence with each manipulation 
	required to produce a possible date match.
